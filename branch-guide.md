# Branch Guide for Corpspace Project

This guide outlines the branch management strategy for the Corpspace project.

# Main Branch

The main branch is considered the main and stable branch of the project. 
All changes are merged into this branch after successful code review and testing.

# Development Branch

The development branch serves as the integration branch for all new feature and bug fix branches.

# Feature Branches

Feature branches are created for each new feature that is being developed. 
The branch name should be descriptive and reflect the feature being developed. For example, feature/user-authentication. 
Feature branches are created from the development branch and are merged back into development after the feature is completed and approved by the code review process.

# Release Branches

In preparation for a new release, a release branch is created from the development branch. 
The release branch is used to track any last-minute changes, bug fixes, and testing before the release.

# Delete Branches

Once a branch has been successfully merged, it is deleted to keep the branch history clean.

# Code Review and Merging

All code changes should be reviewed by a team member before being merged into the development branch. 
The code review process helps to maintain the quality of the code and ensures that all changes are aligned with the project goals and coding standards.

Please follow these guidelines when working with branches in the Corpspace project. 
If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to the project maintainers.
