# Corpspace - BRANCH GUIDE

Following are the most important branches:

- `main`: General branch.
- `develop`: Contains the latest code **and it is the branch actively developed**. Note that **all PRs must be against the `develop` branch to be considered**.

Any other branch is considered temporary and could be deleted at any time. Do not submit any PR against them!

Thanks!
